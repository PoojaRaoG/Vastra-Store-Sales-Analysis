# 🥻 Vastra-Store-Sales-Analysis
## A comprehensive end-to-end Excel project transforming raw retail data into interactive dashboards for data-driven business growth.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the sales performance of **Vastra Store**, an apparel retailer. I transformed a messy raw dataset into two interactive dashboards to help the business visualize its monthly sales trends, customer behavior, and gender-based shopping habits.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary goal of this analysis was to use **Microsoft Excel** as an end-to-end data tool to provide the Vastra Store with actionable business insights. Specifically, the objectives were:

- To clean and standardize inconsistent labels (e.g., "m" and "w" labels) to ensure data accuracy.
- To identify **seasonal sales trends** and top-performing product **categories**.
- To analyze **customer demographics** (age groups and gender) to target the most profitable audience segment.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: The primary platform for all data analysis, cleaning, logic, and visualization.
- **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts**: Used to summarize over 30,000+ rows of data and generate interactive visual insights.
- **Slicers**: Integrated into the dashboards to allow users to filter data by **Quarter, Month, Channel, and Category**.

## 🛠 Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Used filtering and the **Find & Replace** tool to fix inconsistencies and standardize text entries. For example, I converted all variations like "m" and "w" into "Men" and "Women" to ensure accurate gender-based reporting.
- **Age Grouping**: Created a new calculated column using **Nested IF** formulas to categorize customers into specific age groups: **Teenager, Adult, and Senior**.
- **Time Transformation**: Used the **TEXT function** to extract the month from transaction dates. This was essential for identifying monthly sales trends.
- **Data Summarization**: Utilized **Pivot Tables** and **Pivot Charts** to quickly aggregate and summarize transactional data.

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard
I created two distinct dashboards to provide a Comprehensive view of Vastra Store's performance:

- **Sales Analysis Dashboard**: This is the primary business tool used to track monthly sales trends. It features interactive **Slicers** that allow users to filter performance by age group and region to identify high-profit areas.
- **Gender Analysis Dashboard**: This is a targeted demographic tool designed for the marketing team. It analyzes the specific shopping habits of men versus women.
